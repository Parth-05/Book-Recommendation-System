## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **JavaScript**: For creating a dynamic and responsive user interface.

### Backend
- **Flask**: For building the backend and handling communication between the frontend and data processing components.

### Data Processing and Analysis
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment for developing and testing the recommendation algorithms.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations and data handling.
- **cosine similarity**: Algorithm for calculating similarity between books to generate recommendations.

- ## Project Architecture

1. **Data Collection**:
    - Data is collected and preprocessed using Python libraries such as pandas and numpy.
    
2. **Data Processing**:
    - The data is processed to extract meaningful features.
    - Cosine similarity is used to compute the similarity between different books based on user preferences and book attributes.
    
3. **Backend Development**:
    - Flask is used to build the backend server, which handles requests from the frontend and communicates with the recommendation algorithm.
    
4. **Frontend Development**:
    - JavaScript is utilized to create a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the recommendation system.
    - The UI fetches data from the Flask backend and displays personalized book recommendations to the user.
    
5. **Deployment**:
    - The entire system is deployed to ensure seamless integration between the frontend and backend, providing users with real-time recommendations.
